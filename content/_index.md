### Hi there :wave:

I am currently a Post-Doc at the Technion in the group of [Yonatan Belinkov](https://belinkov.com) where I work in the areas of Information Retrieval, NLP, and Interpretability.

In May 2024, I finished my PhD in Computer Science at the [Dresden Database Research Group](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/sya/db) at TU Dresden. In my PhD thesis, I developed approaches for incorporating Transformer-Encoder models for Mathematical Retrieval and interpreted what these models had learned during their training.

Before that, I studied Computer Science at TU Dresden, where I received my Diplom (ancient German degree combining Bachelor and Master) in September 2019. My thesis was on un-/ semi-supervised appraoches for Grammatical Error Correction in English, where I explored the usage of Variational Autoencoders and backtranslation.

During my studies, I spent a semester each at the Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan (2015/16), and at the NLP Lab of the National University of Singapore (2018). In addition, I also spent one semester in China helping children to learn English while improving my Chinese (2017).
